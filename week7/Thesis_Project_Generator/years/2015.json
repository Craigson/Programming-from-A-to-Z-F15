Users are gently encouraged to create their own personal hierarchies of tasks and activities that get progressively more difficult as each one is completed. The application also collects and saves data through a daily check-in system and journal that allows users to share their progress and feelings with their therapist.","project_id":"4804"},{"project_name":"Smart Mat","elevator_pitch":"Smart Mat lets you track your yoga practice in a new way.

The electronic gadget will have its first debut on the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. "Fuleirinho" will first be used in a football game and stadium context, where the light will represent the crowd's emotions. The object has an embedded microphone as the input and, as the output, colored LEDs based on the teams' national flags. The device, when used by a crowd, will display amazing visuals, providing an authentic fan experience for the stadium audience and those watching the games on television. The louder the crowd cheers, the brighter the device gets.

A few quick experiments have shown that moving the manual filter significantly affects the frequencies created by banging the drum, which results in an ability to change a sound gradually or drastically using one's hands, and without the need of any additional MEDIATIATON, something I want to avoid. <br \/>\r\nInitially, for the first 3 weeks, I will work on the percussive elements without a frame, or setup, so I won't occupy much space. Stuff like the foam that helps with the dampening does occupy space, and I definitely need a place to store the drum I'm using for my experiments as it is not mine and want to keep it somewhat sheltered if possible.","project_id":"4822"},{"project_name":"Video Trajectories","elevator_pitch":"","description":"Video Trajectories is a series of experiments using 3 objects of video capture: a Raspberry Pi, a head-mounted GoPro, and a smart phone.
