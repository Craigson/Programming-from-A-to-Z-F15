# Programming from A to Z, Fall 2015

This course focuses on programming strategies and techniques behind procedural analysis and generation of text-based data. We'll explore topics ranging from evaluating text according to its statistical properties to the automated production of text with probabilistic methods to text visualization. Students will learn server-side and client-side JavaScript programming and develop projects that can be shared and interacted with online.  There will be weekly homework assignments as well as a final project.

   * ["Try" Git tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
* Github Pages: By no means, is github pages required for hosting your projects.  But it's free and fast and lives on github.  So there are many reasons why you might like to consider it, at least during the homework / experimentation stage / of a project.
   * [A Guide to Github pages](https://www.thinkful.com/learn/a-guide-to-using-github-pages/)
* p5.js

* Client-side vs. Server-side?
* Text mashups
   * "Cut-ups"
      * [Cut-up Method](http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/burroughs-cutup.html) from  Leroi Jones, ed., The Moderns: An Anthology of New Writing in America (NY: Corinth Books, 1963).

      * Excerpt from Virtual Muse: Experiments In Computer Poetry pgs. 95-96
      * [Online Diastic generator](http://www.eddeaddad.net/eDiastic/)
* Assignment: Find a source text and manually perform one of the mashup techniques above (or make up your own.)  Create a webpage with the results using some combination of HTML, CSS, and/or p5.js. Host the page on github pages (or your own server).  There is no need for programming for this assignment, it's just about getting set up in the environment.  However, you may choose to include animated or interactive elements if you like.
